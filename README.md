XYZ Paints Inc. is a paint company that was recently launched in 2019. Since then, they have established their name in top tier 1 and 2 cities (slowly expanding to tier 3 cities as well).

They have orders coming from household, industrial, and government sectors. In recent years, they have seen quite a steady growth and would like to continue that in the future.

They have hired me as a Data Analyst in their data consulting team which offers services across various departments such as sales, marketing, logistics, etc.

They have given us a sample of data from their databases.

Our team has to work on some of the pain points of the marketing team like consumer growth, lead conversions, etc. as well as help them work on a new set of campaigns or do market basket analysis.
